\chapter{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this project demonstrated the use of Virtual Holonomic Constraints in simple, 2\textsuperscript{nd}-degree underactuated mechanical systems with 1 degree of symmetry. Using Matlab, the constrained dynamics of these systems were analyzed and simulated. The systems' constrain manifolds were decomposed into an Ehresmann-like connection of vertical and horizontal vector fields. This dynamical reduction technique can be useful in simplifying the dynamics of robotic applications that require the enforcement of Virtual Holonomic Constraints, such as maintaining set distances between agents or synchronizing the motions of joints. Overall, the study of virtual holonomic constraints has potential applications in the field of robotics and further research in this area may lead to new and improved control strategies.
