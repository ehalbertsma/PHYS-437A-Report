\chapter{Acknowledgements}
To my supervisor, Professor Chris Nielsen: a sincere thank you for taking me as a student this term. While we had to navigate a few logistical obstacles before successfully launching the project, things went well as we progressed. I learned a lot about geometric mechanics, controls, and the research process, and I've greatly appreciated your mentorship and feedback along the way.

Thank you to my outstanding academic advisor, Professor Richard Epp, for encouraging me to take on a project, and for supporting me through the final year of my degree. 

Thank you to my friends Michael Astwood and Basel Jayyusi for teaching me some differential geometry fundamentals, and reminding me of the beauty of mathematics.
