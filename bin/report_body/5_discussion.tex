\section{Sources of Error}
The Matlab program is susceptible to error under some conditions.

\section{Future Research}
\subsection{Analyze further examples}
As discussed in Section \ref{sec:robotarmoffset}, the Robotic Arm Offset example is somewhat trivial, as its reduced form is apparent at all points on the constraint manifold $\mathcal{C}$.

Therefore, future research should explore further examples of mechanical systems, with the aim to provide a more concrete illustration of the technique of dynamical reduction described by McCarthy et al\cite{mccarthy}. 
Tedrake's notes on Underactuated Robotics\cite{underactuated} contain some examples that (with perhaps some modifications) could be used in a continuation of this work. It is recommended to choose systems with 4 degrees of freedom and 2 actuators--systems with 3 degrees of freedom and 1 actuator may not be as interesting to study.
